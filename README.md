NET-SNMP for OpenELEC

NET-SNMP version: 5.7.2
OpenELEC version: 4.0.7

Very light weight net-snmp installation compiled from scratch with for snmpd only.

default version: 2c
default community: openelec

This is my first attempt at creating an add-on for openelec and I hope its right.  I've installed and tested this on 2 different Generic x86_64 PCs.
